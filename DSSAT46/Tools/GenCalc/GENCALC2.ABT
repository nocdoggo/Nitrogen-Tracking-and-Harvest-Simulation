  GENERAL

    GENCALC2 is software that makes use of crop models to 
  determine cultivar trait coefficients from data reported 
  for an array of experiments. The name GENCALC stands for 
  Genotype Coefficient Calculator, and the digit '2' indicates 
  that the program is an update of the original calculator 
  included in the DSSAT 3.5 package, and described in:

    Hunt,L.A.,S.Pararajaysingham,J.W.Jones,G.Hoogenboom,
    D.T.Imamura,and R.M.Ogoshi. 1993 GENCALC:Software to 
    facilitate the use of crop models for analyzing field 
    experiments.  Agronomy J. 85(5):1090-1094
  
    For use with Gencalc2, the crop models and, if more than 
  one crop module is included, the individual crop modules, 
  must have eight character names, and must use CULTIVAR and 
  ECOTYPE files which have the same structure as the files 
  used by the DSSAT models and names matching the model or 
  module name. For example, if the model executable was 
  DSCSM046.EXE, then the cultivar file must be SBGRO046.CUL
  
    Additionally, the models must generate an EVALUATE.OUT 
  file which conforms to the standards set up for DSSAT, 
  and make use of a configuration file similar to the 
  DSSATPRO file of DSSAT. They also should be launchable 
  with a command line argument which contains the name of a 
  file containing information on the experiment/treatment 
  combinations to be used. For the DSSAT CSM model, the 
  command line could have (depending on general 
  configuration) the following form:
  
  C:\DSSAT46\TOOLS\GENCALC2 BRAGG.SBC DSSATPRO.V46 DSCSM046_GC2.CTR
  
  In which the BRAGG.SBC is the name of a file containing a list 
  of experiment/treatment combinations to be used, the 
  DSSATPRO.V46 indicates that the program is to run using the 
  Dssat V46 configuration file, and the DSCSM046_GC2.CTR indicates
  that the Gencalc simulation control file is to be used for 
  all experiments. The names of all of these files can be 
  changed, and the control file name can be omitted. If a 
  control file is indicated, however, this file will be used 
  for all experiments and, depending on its contents, all 
  controls at the bottom of X-files could be ignored.
  

  SETUP  

    The Gencalc2 executable file must be reside in a
  directory in which the auxilliary files (Gencalc2.Rul
  and Gencalc2.Abt) are located. A configuration file
  conforming in structure to the files used in Dssat 
  (e.g.Dssatpro.v46) must be present along with a Dssat 
  codes file (Data.cde) in the root directory of the 
  tree containing the Gencalc2 executable. And the 
  program must be run from the directory containing 
  the file listing the experiment/treatment combinations 
  to be used. An example of an appropriate setup, as 
  needed for running under Dssat, is:
  
           Directory                 Files
           
           C:\Dssat46\Tools\Gencalc  Gencalc2.Exe 
                                     Gencalc2.Rul
                                     Gencalc2.Abt    
                                    
           C:\Dssat46                Dssatpro.V46
                                     Data.Cde
                                    
           C:\Dssat46\GCWork         Newton.Whc                                   
           
  The program will need access to a text editor and a graphing
  program, and these must be defined in the appropriate spot in
  the configuration file. And if running under DSSAT Gencalc2 
  needs to be accompanied by a selector program (currently 
  named Gencalc.exe) and its associated help file, Gencalc.chm.      
  
  
  MODE OF OPERATION 

    The program works by running the model with a number 
  of different sets of cultivar coefficients. The outputs
  from the model runs are examined, and the coefficient set
  that results in the least difference (evaluated using 
  the Root Mean Square Error) between simulated and measured 
  values over all runs is selected. 
  
    An initial set of cultivar coefficients is obtained from 
  the cultivar file each time that the RUN option is activated.
  Changes made to this file after a set of runs has been 
  completed will thus be reflected in the initial coefficients 
  used for a new set of runs. 
  
  RULES FILE

    Overall control of the program resides in a so-called RULES 
  file. This file is structured in conformity with the ICASA file 
  standards, and has one overall CONTROL section and individual 
  CROP MODULE section for each of the crop models or modules 
  that may be used with the program. 
  
  RULES FILE - CROP MODULE SECTION
  
    The CROP MODULE sections contain information on the number 
  of simulations to be conducted, on the changes to be made to 
  the cultivar coefficients, and on the aspects that are to be
  used to determine error (the 'Target' trait) during one 'pass' 
  of calibration runs. The sections have a header line and 
  individual 'rules' lines as indicated below:
    
  @TARGET............ (ExCOEFF),STEP,COEFF,LOOPS
   ADAP  FLOWERING    'E',10.0,CSDL,3 10.0,EM-FL,3  
  
  in which the standard abbreviation for the target aspect 
  is given along with a brief description, followed by 
  information on the coefficient(s) to be changed. The 
  standard abbreviations are those present in the model
  output file 'Evaluate.out'. The abbreviations used in
  the rules file should thus be compared to those in 
  Evaluate.out, and if necessary changed to the 
  Evaluate.out standard,when Gencalc fails to find 
  a match match for the desired target trait. 
  
    The coefficients are defined using the abbreviations 
  from the cultivar coefficient file. Each abbreviation 
  is preceded by a 'step' value, and followed by a 'loop'
  number. The step value defines the amount that the 
  coefficient will be changed, given as a percentage of
  the value in the coefficients file; and the loop value
  defines the number of simulations that will be performed 
  for the coefficient during one calculation 'pass' for
  the rule in question. The 'step' value may be preceded 
  by a flag ('E') indicating that the coefficient is to
  be excluded from any optimization calculations called 
  for in the overall control section. Only one such
  'explore' coefficient is allowed for each line of rules.
  
    The starting coeficient value is calculated as:
  
    INITIAL value * (1.0 - (Step/100)*((Loops-1)/2)) 
  
  Thus, if the step is entered as 10.0 and the loop number
  as 3, the first simulation would be run with a coefficient 
  10% less than the initial value, the last run with a value 
  10% greater. And if the loop number was entered as 5, the 
  first coefficient value would be 20% less than the initial
  value. The INITIAL value is generally the value in the
  cultivar (CUL) file, but when this is small and the
  settings in the CONTROL section of the rules are appropriate
  (see below), it is the difference between the maximum and 
  minimum values for the coefficient in question.
  
    Depending on the entries in the rules file, the model 
  will run for one 'target' trait, then for a second, and
  so on until the coefficient changes for the final trait
  have been run. The coefficients which produce the least 
  error for the first target are used during runs with the 
  second target, and so on throughout the rules package. 
  
  RULES FILE - CONTROL SECTION
  
    The CONTROL section contains:
       1. 'Flags' that determine whether message boxes will 
  be displayed (and thir associated 'beeps' sounded),  
  whether information on the maximum and minimum coefficient
  values will be used when changing coefficient values during
  calibration,and whether a large number of messages will be
  written to the LOG file during a Gencalc run.
       2. Two control numbers that determine the maximum number 
  of repeat calibration 'passes' that will be made. These repeats
  are not made for coefficients flagged with an 'E' as 'Explore' 
  coefficients.
       3. A value that determines the minimum size of the change 
  in coeffcient value. This minimum change size is inputed as a 
  percentage value, and this value is multiplied by the difference 
  between the minimum and maximum coefficient values as documented 
  in the cultivar (CUL) file,to determine the minimum value used
  within the program for each coefficient.       

  The #2 aspect listed above is necessary firstly because one 
  or more of the best set of coefficients determined at the end 
  of a calculations 'pass' for a specific rule may lie at the 
  extremes of the allowed span of values. In such a case, to 
  determine whether further changes beyond the extremes would 
  result in a better 'fit', a new 'pass' of calibration 
  simulations is made. How many of such new 'passes' are 
  permitted is determined by the control variable, RULER. 

  And the #2 aspect above is necessary secondly because once 
  it is established that the best coefficients do not lie at 
  the extremes of the allowed range, calculations to determine 
  if the optimum coefficient lies at some intermediate value 
  within the range of tried coefficients need to be made. To 
  do this, a series of reductions in step size, followed by 
  re-running for the particular rule until no change in 'fit' 
  is noted, are made. Such changes in step size (a halving the 
  initial step size) are under the control the control variable, 
  RULEC. This variable sets the maximum number of changes in step 
  size for each rule. 


  MISSING INITIAL VALUES

    The initial set of cultivar coefficients is obtained from 
  the cultivar file using the cultivar identifier. If no entry
  with the identifier is present in the file, a set of values
  is entered for the missing cultivar using one of the defaults 
  (i.e. those with an identifier beginning with '99') or one of
  the named cultivars at the top of the file. The default to be 
  used must be chosen using a selector box that appears on the 
  screen, and then adding the cultivar to the CUL file by 
  activating the 'Add' item in the 'Action' menu.(The selector
  box and the 'Add' menu option only appears when the cultivar 
  listed in the experiment details file is missing from the CUL 
  file).


  CONFLICTING NAMES

    If the name in the cultivar list file, which is obtained 
  from the first experiment details file used, does not match 
  with the name in the cultivar file, a warning message may be
  (depending on the control settings) be presented on the screen, 
  and the user may be asked to choose whether to proceed or to 
  abort a run. Such a conflict may merely stem from a typing error, 
  or the addition of some information on the type or class of 
  cultivar (e.g. HRS for hard red spring wheat) in the cultivar 
  file. Alternatively, it may result because the number used in 
  the experiment file had already been assigned to another 
  cultivar. In this latter case, the run should be aborted and 
  the experiment files edited to change the number assigned to 
  the cultivar in those files. If the message boxes are turned 
  off, however, no such message is available and a user should 
  review the LOG file after a calibration session to determine 
  if there was a problem with the cultivar numbers before 
  upgrading the coefficient file.

     
  ECOTYPE COEFFICIENTS

    The cultivar optimization can be conducted with a number 
  of different sets of ecotype coefficients, so permitting an
  optimization for one or more of the ecotype coefficient sets.
  To do this, additional sets of ecotype coefficients should be 
  added to an 'Options' ecotype file before starting a 
  calibration run.
  
    To edit the Options ecotype file, activate the 'Files',
  'Coefficients','Options Eco File' menu, duplicate (as
  many times as desired) the single line of coefficients that
  will be present in the file, change the values of the
  coefficients that are to be explored, and save the file.    


  WORKING AND BACKUP COEFFICIENT FILES
  
    To avoid having to make changes to the main cultivar and
  ecotype files, Gencalc2 creates 'working' cultivar and ecotype
  files that are used by the crop simulation model when running in
  calibration mode. These files reside in the directory from which 
  Gencalc2 is running; and they are named 'GENCALC2.CUL' and 
  'GENCALC2.ECO'. 

    And to avoid the possibility of potentially losing the main 
  cultivar and ecotype files, Gencalc2 also creates 'backup' files 
  that can be used to replace lost or corrupted files following
  power or computer failure. These files, which reside in the same 
  directory as the working files, are named 'BACKUP.CUL' and 
  'BACKUP.ECO'.


  EXPERIMENT/TREATMENT (BATCH) FILES

    The batch files, which contain lists of the experiment/treatment 
  combinations to be used, must have the form shown below:
  
  $BATCH(CULTIVAR):SBIB0001 BRAGG
 
  @FILEX                                 TRTNO  RP  SQ  OP  CO
  C:\DSSAT46\GCWork\UFGA7801.SBX             1   0   1   1   1
  C:\DSSAT46\GCWork\UFGA7801.SBX             2   0   1   1   1
  
  The files are designed to allow for the specification of both treatment 
  number (TRTNO), treatment replicate number (RP), position in a sequence
  of crops (SQ,OP), and component of a crop with multiple components (CO). 
  Currently, however, the replicate option is not used by many crop models, 
  including the CSM model in DSSAT, and so a '0' is entered to indicate 
  that mean values are  to be used.
  
    The files can be created using a text editor of choice and manually
  entering the required information. This process can be rather tedious,
  however, and it is generally easier to create the files by using a 
  'selector' program that displays the experiment/treatment combinations 
  available for a specified cultivar, allows a user to select desired
  combinations, and inserts these selected combinations into a new or 
  existing batch file. Such a 'selector' program is available in DSSAT.
  It is described under the heading 'ABOUT GENSELECT' at the foot of
  this file.

    For individual runs, it may be desirable to eliminate, or comment 
  out (with a ! in the first position) existing treatments, or add new 
  ones in which the same cultivar is present. This can be done by
  activating the appropriate item in the 'Files' menu list, and then 
  editing the file. After accessing the file, even if no changes are made, 
  the run number is re-freshed.
     
       
  CONFIGURATION FILE
  
    The configuration file can be accessed and edited by
  activating the appropriate item in the 'Files' menu list. In 
  the file, the editor, graphics program, and model/module can 
  be changed.

  
  CHECKING DATASETS   
  
    Before proceeding to calibration, a 'check' run should be
  made to ensure that the model will run with all experiment/
  treatment combinations. This could be done by running from 
  the model interface but, when a lot of experiment/treatment 
  combinations are to be examined, is perhaps best done by 
  choosing the 'Check' option from the 'Action' menu.
    
    If the model does not run with one of the combinations,
  a message will be written to the Log file and possibly to
  a message box on the screen, and the run will be terminated. 
  Examine the model 'Error.out' file to determine the reason 
  for failure, and correct the problem before proceeding. 
  Alternatively, the 'offending' experiment/treatment 
  combination could be removed from the list file. 
  
    Once the model runs with all combinations, proceed to 
  examine the Evaluation.out file to ensure that the 
  simulated emergence dates appear reasonable. If this was not 
  the case, check the individual experiments to determine
  the cause of a delayed emergence, and correct whatever 
  problems were identified before proceeding with calibration.
  
    Finally, check the Overview.out file to ensure that the 
  correct weather data had been used for the individual runs.
  This could happen if the planting date had been erroneously
  entered as sometimes happens with crops that are planted in 
  one year, harvested in another.  


  MESSAGE BOXES AND 'BEEPS'
    
   In public areas such as libraries and communal labs, 'beeps' during
  a calibration session could be disturbing to neighbouring workers. 
  Because of this, the program allows a user to swich-off most beeps 
  together with their associated message boxes. Control over these aspects
  resides in a MSGBX 'flag' in the CONTROL section of the RULES file.
  This 'flag' can be set to N or Y:
     Y  All message boxes are written to the screen, and all 'beeps' 
        are sounded. 
     N  Message boxes are written, and 'beeps' sounded, only when no 
        rules file is found at the start of a session, or when no 
        log file is found when trying to edit the log. The ecotype 
        option file is automatically recreated after editing the ecotype 
        file, with no user option for aborting this step.
  If no control section is present, the MSGBX 'flag' is set to Y.  
  
  
  RUNNING
  
    A calibration run is initiated by activating the 'Action' -
  'Run' menu item. Before initiating a comprehensive calibration
  run, however, users should determine if the time that will be 
  needed for the calibration run fits in with other demands on 
  computer and personal time. This can be done by examining the 
  'Runs needed' box on the computer screen and then making a 
  quick mental calculation of the total time necessary for an 
  individual run. The 'runs needed' box indicates the maximum
  number of individual simulation runs that the contents of 
  the list and rules files call for, taking into account 
  possible re-runs and step size changes. With information
  from this box, plus pre-knowledge of the time necessary for 
  one simulation, a general overall calculation of the maximum
  time neccessary can be made. 

    Users should note that results from calibrating the timing 
  of later stages in the growth cycle are not truly meaningfull 
  until the earlier stages have been well calibrated, and that 
  calibration of growth and yield aspects is not meaningfull 
  until phenology is well simulated. The Rules file should thus
  not be edited in such a manner that rules for early phases
  appear after later phases, or rules for growth aspects before
  those for phenology. 
 
    Once initiated, the progress of the calibration run is
  indicated in a 'Runs completed' box at the base of the screen.              
  However, because the model uses the list file, the number of
  runs completed is only up-dated when all experiment/treatment 
  combinations in the list file have been completed for one set
  of coefficient values. On completion, and depending on the 
  message box control variable, a 'beep' may be sounded and a 
  message box placed on the screen.    
  
    If it is desired to stop a calibration run, activating the
  'Cancel' button at the base of the screen will stop the run
  as soon as control is returned from the model to Gencalc2 (i.e.
  when all experiment/treatments in the list file have been 
  completed for the coefficients being examined at the time of
  activation).  
  
  
  EXAMINING RESULTS
  
    Gencalc2 produces a number of files showing the results 
  of the succession of simulation runs, together with the
  coefficients used in the runs. These files can be examined
  by activating the menu items under 'Files', 'Results'. 
  
    The 'Details' file contains the simulated and measured 
  values for each individual model run, 'Summary', the errors 
  after running all experiment/treatment combinations with 
  one of the required sets of coefficients, sorted so that 
  runs with the smallest errors appear at the top. And finally
  'Minima' with the 'best' results for the runs with different 
  target traits, and 'Comparison' with errors for all traits
  for which data are available (not only those used as targets).
  This latter file, in which errors using the original 
  coefficients are compared with those using the 'best' 
  coefficients from the calibration run, is probably the most
  useful in deciding whether to upgrade the cultivar file
  with the calibration results.
  
    There is one additional results file produced if one of the
  coefficients has been defined as an 'Explore' coefficient. This
  contains the results after optimizing other coefficients for 
  the different values specified for the 'Explore' coefficient.   
  
    Before proceeding to these 'Results' files, however, it is
  worthwhile examining the 'Log' file to see if Gencalc2 had
  detected any missing simulated data. If so, there would 
  have been some problem either with the coefficients used
  for a particular run (e.g. a vernalization requirement 
  that prevented the crop proceeding to flowering and 
  maturity), or with the model code. In both cases, the 
  causes of the problem should be examined in some detail 
  before proceeding further with a results examination.
        
    The simulation outputs using the final 'best' set of 
  coefficients can be examined by activating the 'Model 
  Outputs' menu item. The Overview gives detail for each
  run with the 'best' coefficients, whilst the Evaluate
  gives a summary comparison of measured and simulated 
  values that can be viewed or plotted, as desired. 
  The graphing program in Dssat V4 does not differentiate 
  between sub-set of data in the Evaluate.out file, and so 
  it is not easy to gain a visual impression of the gains 
  made through calibration. Inspection of the file, or use 
  of an alternative graphing program, however, can provide 
  an insight into gains and/or losses in precision and 
  accuracy.     
  
    When examining results it is important to bear in mind
  that errors in the timing of later stages in the life
  cycle may show an increase when the simulation of earlier
  stages was initially poor. Errors in various growth and  
  yield aspects also may increase when the timing of the
  various growth stages was originally poorly simulated.
  
    And finally, if it is impossible to obtain a set of
  coefficients that result in reasonable correspondence 
  between measured and simulated values, then the 
  Experiment files should be checked carefully for possible
  mis-reporting of initial conditions, management (eg.,
  irrigation schedules), and performance aspects (eg.,
  anthesis date) for some of the experiments/treatment
  combinations used.       


  UPGRADING COEFFICIENTS USING CALIBRATION RESULTS
  
    The coefficients with the least error for the final
  target represent the 'best' overall coefficients for
  all targets, and if desired (after examination of the
  outputs) these can be used to replace (upgrade) the
  coefficients in the cultivar or ecotype files. This is 
  done by activating the 'Automatic' option from the
  'Files','Coefficients','Main cultivar file' menu.

    The coefficients used for upgrading are those present
  in the 'working' cultivar and ecotype files at the end
  of a calibration session. If any of the values in the
  files are changed by using the edit option, the changed
  values will be used when inserting new values into the
  main files. 
    
    When a coefficients upgrade is attempted, the cultivar
  and ecotype files are first copied to backup files, then
  the coefficients in the respective files are replaced. The
  original coefficients, however, are retained in the files, 
  but with a ! in the first column position. To avoid 
  'cluttering' the files with such saved coefficients, 
  a user should thus occassionally manually edit both the
  cultivar and ecotype files and delete saved entries from
  earlier calibration sessions.


  REVIEWING AND USING RESULTS FROM A PREVIOUS SESSION
    
     The results files are not over-writtten until the RUN
  menu item is activated after re-entering GENCALC2. Thus
  a user can return to review previous results after having
  exited the program. The automatic upgrade of the main
  cultivar and ecotype files will also work with the results
  from the previous session until either the CHECK or RUN menu 
  option is activated. Similarly,the model output files are 
  not over-written until either the CHECK or RUN menu items 
  are activated on returning to the program.         
  
  
  PROBLEMS               

    All activities during a session are written to a 'log' 
  file which can be examined by activating the Log menu item
  under Files. All Gencalc2 error messages are written to 
  this file (even though they may first be shown in a message
  box). A model error will be identified in the log file.
  
    When calibrating phenology, coefficients that extend the 
  duration of the life cycle beyond the measured value are
  often explored. This can result in a model error if the
  weather data terminate at the measured maturity date. Such
  a situation can be corrected by duplicating the final days 
  weather and changing the dates for each duplicate at the 
  end of the file. Naturally such additions should be 
  highlighted either by adding some text to the 'Notes' 
  section of the file, or by adding a comment before the
  added 'artificial' data.
  
    Further, a particular set of calibration coefficients 
  may result in the model running with coefficients not 
  normally encountered. Such 'extreme' coefficient values 
  may 'expose' new model problems, and these should be
  communicated to the model developer. To proceed with
  calibration, the rules file should be changed so that
  such 'offending' extreme coefficients are not encountered.


  LIMITS
  
    The program is set-up to run within the following limits:
    
         Experiments                           999
         Experiment/treatment combinations     999
         Cultivar coefficients                  30
         Coefficients in one rule set           12
         Rules sets for one model               20
         Ecotype coefficient options            20
         Cultivars presented for selection      20
         
  If these limts are exceeded an error or warning message will 
  be written to the 'Log' file, and the run will be terminated.        


  POWER OR COMPUTER FAILURES      
  
    In the rare event of a power or computer failure at the time
  of an attempted coefficients file upgrade, the main cultivar 
  and/or ecotype files may become lost or corrupted. In such a case, 
  the backup cultivar and ecotype coefficient files should be copied 
  to serve as replacements for the lost or damaged files.

  GENERAL

    GENSELECT is software that makes it possible:
    
     (A) to select and organize experiment/treatment 
         combinations for use when estimating coefficients 
         for a specific cultivar using the software 
         'GENCALC2'. 
    
     (B) to launch 'GENCALC2' for a chosen cultivar, and with
         a chosen set of experiment/treatment combinations.
         
    The combinations selected using Genselect are listed in 
    a file, the name of which is constructed from the cultivar 
    name, the crop code (e.g. SB for soybean),and a final 'C' 
    (e.g. BRAGG.SBC)


  SETUP  

    The 'GENSELECT' executable file (Gencalc.exe) must reside 
  in a directory in which its auxilliary file (Gencalc.Chm) is
  located. If running under DSSAT, the directory should be:
  
       C(or other chosen drive):\Dssat4\Tools\Gencalc   


  OPERATION - CHOICE OF CROP

    The program will handle appropriate (ie.conforming to 
  DSSAT standards) experimental files for any crop, and so
  the first step in any session is to chose the crop to
  be considered. A user should thus proceed from the main
  screen by pressing the 'StartGenselect' button to proceed 
  to the first 'working' screen, and there, chose the 
  desired crop species.
  
  
  OPERATION - CHOICE OF AN EXISTING 'BATCH' FILE
  
     Once the crop is chosen, a user has two options - to
  chose an existing 'Batch' file and proceed directly to the
  calibration program GENCALC, or to create a new 'List'
  file prior to proceeding. Normally, therefore, the second
  step in any session is to examine the list of experiment/
  treatment combination files that are already present. If 
  there is a file for the cultivar to be examined, the file 
  should be highlighted and then the 'View the GC cultivar 
  file' bar activated, and the file examined to determine 
  if the experiment/treatment combinations desired are 
  included. If so, the 'Use the GC cultivar file' bar should
  be activated to proceed to GENCALC per se. If not, then 
  a new 'Batch' file should be created.

  
  OPERATION - CHOICE OF NEW EXPERIMENT/TREATMENT COMBINATIONS

     The first step in proceding to create a new 'Batch' file 
  with new Experiment/treatment combinations is to select a 
  cultivar and one or more of the data directories listed in
  the 'choice' boxes on the first 'working' screen. If it is 
  desired to include experiments from other directories, 
  activate the 'Scan more directories' bar and select the 
  desired directories. When satisfied, activate the 'Go' 
  button and then select the experiment/treatment combinations
  to be used, remembering that it is best to first work with 
  the non-stressed treatments. Next, activate the 'Go' button 
  and change the batch file name if the indicated name is not 
  acceptable. Once the name is acceptable, activate the 'Save' 
  button. At this stage, all required files will be copied to 
  a working directory and the progress of this copying will be
  displayed in a 'DOS box'. After completing the copying
  process, a screen with several choices will appear. Activate
  the 'Run Gencalc' button to load the Gencalc program, after 
  which the main Gencalc screen should appear on the screen.
